# Temporal Glyph Operator (TGO)

I could be the one,  
your new obsession,  
it's all fractals in my head,  
but I built it with precision.

Snap, clap, sample your frames  
Raise your hands, watch motifs flame  
Sparkline roll, convergence shows  
Dance it out—you're hot to go  

**H-O-T-O-T-G-O** → Temporal Glyph Operator  
You can take it hot-to-go into your research, art, or exploration.

## 💡 What is TGO?

The Temporal Glyph Operator is a simulated proxy observer that:

👀 **Sees** fractal computation as layers of visual data  
🌀 **Compresses** infinite scales into patterns and motifs  
📊 **Generates** real-time metrics: convergence, stability, fractal dimension  
🔬 **Enables** strategy comparison, replay, reproducibility  

Think of it as your research DJ booth:

- Drop in a fractal stream
- Mix strategies side by side  
- Export the beats (LDJSON/CSV)
- Replay the set anytime

## 🚀 Features (Drop the Beat)

🎛 **Adaptive Cadence** — speeds up when energy spikes, chills when stable  
🔎 **Address Lens** — hover and decode fractal space live  
🧩 **Ensemble Strategies** — uniform, energy-biased, address-aware  
🎶 **Strategy Compare Lab** — side-by-side sparklines, divergence timelines  
📀 **Replay Mode** — save, reload, scrub through a whole run  
💾 **Export Everything** — JSON, LDJSON, CSV for external analysis  
🔍 **Peak Detection** — automatically find the most interesting divergence moments  

## 🧪 Research Groove

Run an experiment → let TGO observe fractal chaos.  
Export a session → keep every frame + report in a neat LDJSON.  
Replay it later → scrub the timeline, find the hot spots.  
Compare strategies → see where they agree, where they fight on the floor.

## 🎯 Quick Start

```bash
npm i
npm run dev
```

Then hit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and let the fractals flow.

## ❤️ Made With Love

Every line of code, every canvas pixel, and every sparkline curve in TGO is made with:

💜 **curiosity**  
🧠 **nerd-level rigor**  
🎉 **and a refusal to make it boring.**

Because research tools should feel like art, not spreadsheets.
