## Overview

The Temporal Glyph Operator is a sophisticated research platform for fractal analysis that represents a new paradigm in computational fractal research. It combines real-time multi-viewport observation, motif convergence tracking, evidence-based intelligence, and reproducible experimental sessions.

## Architecture

### Core Packages

- **`@glyph/core`** â€” Fractal address system and frame bus
- **`@glyph/vision-kernel`** â€” Image pyramid generation and perceptual hashing
- **`@glyph/viewport-manager`** â€” Multi-viewport sampling strategies and ensemble analysis
- **`@glyph/proxy-operator`** â€” Temporal event loop with adaptive cadence
- **`@glyph/report-engine`** â€” Evidence-based reporting and session recording

### Applications

- **`@glyph/viewer`** â€” Next.js web interface with real-time fractal visualization
- **Session Replay** â€” Offline analysis of exported experimental runs
- **Strategy Compare** â€” Side-by-side evaluation of sampling approaches

## Key Features

### ðŸ§  Intelligence Pack
- **Evidence Bullets**: Confidence-scored motif analysis with persistence tracking
- **Adaptive Cadence**: Energy-based reporting frequency (120ms â†” 500ms)
- **Stability Integration**: Rolling stability S feeds into evidence confidence

### ðŸ”¬ Research Rigor Pack
- **Session Recording**: Complete experimental runs captured in LDJSON format
- **Ensemble Mode**: Parallel execution of multiple sampling strategies
- **Data Export**: CSV, JSON, and LDJSON formats for external analysis
- **Replay Interface**: Load and analyze exported sessions offline

### âš¡ Performance & Extensibility Pack
- **Web Worker Offload**: Heavy computations moved to background threads
- **ImageBitmap Integration**: Efficient frame processing with OffscreenCanvas
- **Pluggable Strategies**: Uniform, energy-biased, and address-aware sampling
